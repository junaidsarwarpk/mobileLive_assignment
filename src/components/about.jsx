    This project was developed by Junaid Sarwar (junaidsarwar001@gmail.com) as code assessment task given by Mobile Live. I have tried to use different
type of components here i.e. Functional Components (presentation only), Class based components with lifecycle hooks and 
Functional components with react hooks (hooks were added in React 16.8 which allow functional component to behave
 like react components i.e. mimic lifecycle hooks and use the `state` for functional components). 
 Just for the implementation of Router I have added 2 routes, on root we have our business logic and 
 on `/about` I have added an introduction.

export default About;
