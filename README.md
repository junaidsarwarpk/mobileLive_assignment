### `Inrtoduction`

This project was developed by Junaid Sarwar (junaidsarwar001@gmail.com) as code assessment task given by Mobile Live. I have tried to use different type of components here i.e. Functional Components (presentation only), Class based components with lifecycle hooks and Functional components with react hooks (hooks were added in React 16.8 which allow functional component to behave like react components i.e. mimic lifecycle hooks and use the `state` for functional components). Just for the implementation of Router I have added 2 routes, on root we have our business logic and on `/about` I have added an introduction.
